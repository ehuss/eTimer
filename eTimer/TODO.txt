- Make it prettier.

- Keep counting after timer expires.
  - If you miss the timer, lets you know how long ago you missed it.
  - Unfortunately, can't detect a dismissed local notification.

- Stopwatch mode.
  - Enabled when you clear the timer to zero.

- More alarms.

- launch screen, etc.

Themes
======
- Split the colors up more (need independent control over labels vs buttons, etc.)
- Have fun adding more themes.
  - Holidays: Halloween, Christmas, etc.
  - Sports, National, other group-oriented colors.

Future
======
- One could add many features to this.
  - Nested alarms/themes.
  - Downloadable alarms/themes.
  - Support different devices (ipad mini, ipad, etc.).

- Investigate more into how the stock Timer app overrides:
  - mute switch
  - force a large popup on screen
  I suspect there is no way to do this on stock iOS.  People have noticed that
  in some cases, Apple checks for com.apple bundle id's for some of their
  private APIs.
  I'm guessing that the stock Timer app runs as a background app, with
  background audio rights.  See NOTES.txt for some notes on this.
