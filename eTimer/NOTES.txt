Misc
====
- I'm very unhappy with the UILocalNotification.  One major problem is that
  there does not appear to be a way to stop the sound.
  An alternative is to make this a background app, with the rights necessary
  to play sound from the background.  There might be a risk of having the
  process suspended or killed, but keeping a local notification with no sound
  (or the default sound) to wake the screen up.
  It would be nice to figure out if it's possible to use private API's to
  display the same kind of alert the stock alarm uses.

Sounds
======
- Use CAF IMA4 format (decent compression), less than 30 seconds.
  afconvert -f caff -d ima4 extreme_clock_alarm.mp3 extreme_clock_alarm.caf
  
Beta/Bugs
=========
- Unable to images like bell.png into Images.xcassets because it won't work
  when deploying to iOS 7, per the xcode release notes:
  
    Images from asset catalogs in projects with a minimum deployment target of iOS 7 or OS X
    10.9 will be available when running on iOS 8 and OS X 10.10, but not iOS 7 and OS X 10.9.
